        <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl">fowl</a>, a subspecies of the red junglefowl
            (Gallus gallus). Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total
            population of
            23.7 billion as of 2018.[1] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There are more chickens in the world
            than
            any other bird or domesticated fowl.<sup><a href="www.porn.com">[2]</a></sup> Humans keep chickens primarily
            as a source of food (consuming both their
            meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies,
            chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).[3][4]

            Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia,
            Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but with the clade found in the Americas,
            Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent.
            From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor,
            and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[6] Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th
            century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come to Egypt from the
            land between Syria and Shinar,
            Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[7][8][9]
